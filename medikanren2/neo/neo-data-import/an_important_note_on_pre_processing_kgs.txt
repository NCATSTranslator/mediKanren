There is an issue with the data in `rtx-kg2pre_7.6`, and perhaps in
other KGs.

In the `nodes.tsv` file of `rtx-kg2pre_7.6`, some lines contain the
carriage return character ^M, presumably from DOS.

Alas, the mediKanren processing scripts for the KGs do not handle this
properly, which can result in a "wrong number of columns" error during
processing or use of the KG.

So, we must remove the offending carriage return characters before
running a script in `../neo-data-import/transform-2tsv-to-4tsv-kgs/`
to transform the 2 TSV KG into the 4 TSV format (which then will be
imported into a dbKanren-compatible database).

These two pages describe the ^M carriage return character:

Important: the standard `dos2unix` utility does *not* appear to process the file correctly!
Which is why we use the `sed` approach instead.

To check if a file contains the offending carriage return character, you can run from the terminal (in the directory containing the TSV files):

```
ack ^M <file name>
```

For example, `ack ^M nodes.tsv`

However, you need to enter the ^M character correctly on the command line, as control-v followed by control-m


If the file contains the offending carriage return character, we must create a version of the TSV file without the carriage return:

```
sed  -e "s/^M//g" nodes.tsv > nodes_dos_free.tsv
```

Once again, you need to enter the ^M character correctly on the command line, as control-v followed by control-m

After running the `sed` script, the command

```
ack ^M nodes_dos_free.tsv
```

should not find any lines with the offending carriage return (once again, please enter ^M as command-v followed by command-m)

Also, we should check that the only difference between the two versions of the TSV files are the lines containing ^M:

```
diff nodes.tsv nodes_dos_free.tsv > out.diff.txt
```


The script

`./transform-2tsv-to-4tsv-kgs/transform-rtx-kg2pre_7.6.rkt`

looks for the file `edges.tsv`, but looks for `nodes_dos_free.tsv` rather than `nodes.tsv`.


It would be good to automate this checking/fixing of the TSV files, as part of automated KG processing.
