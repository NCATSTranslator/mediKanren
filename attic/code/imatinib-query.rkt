;; We are going to write a query that tries to find a disease 'Ds'
;; that a given drug 'Dg' might treat, but for which SemMedDB doesn't
;; contain a direct TREATS edge between 'Dg' and 'Ds'.  That is, we
;; are trying to find "surprising" drug/disease links that might be
;; worth further exploration.
;;
;; THE BIGGER PROBLEM
;;
;; One important question this example query is meant to explore is
;; whether we can avoid the combinatorial, exponential explosion of
;; possible paths between the given drug 'Dg' and the "unknown"
;; disease 'Ds'.  SemMedDB has millions of edges, 25,000 diseases,
;; thousands of drugs, etc.  If we are naive, we can easily end
;; generating millions of paths between the given drug 'Dg' and the
;; tens of thousands of unknown diseases.  We might think of this as
;; the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" problem
;; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon): from
;; any disease there may be thousands, or even hundreds of thousands,
;; of indirect paths bewteen that drug and and specific disease.  Not
;; only does this phenomenon lead to computationally intractable
;; problems, it also can overwhelm the human user with far too many
;; answers to consider in a lifetime, most of which are of extremely
;; dubious quality.  For example, there are over 180,000 (relatively
;; short!) paths just between imatinib and asthma in SemMedDB.
;;
;; To avoid this problem, we are going to try to be clever, in
;; multiple dimensions.  We are going to use various forms of
;; reasoning, including trying to explore connections between
;; concepts, exploring more specific drugs before exploring classes of
;; drugs, throwing out "degenrate" answers like 'Disease' that are so
;; general they are guaranteed to lead to exponential explosion, and
;; any other techniques that seem likely to avoid combinatorial
;; explosion in a wide class of queries, without being so aggressive
;; that useful answers are throw out.
;;
;; Philosophically, this is similar to how a chess engine like
;; Stockfish works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)).
;; Even though the average branching factor in chess is around 35, the
;; best engines use heuristics to reduce the *effective* branching
;; factor to under 2.  That is, when trying to decide on the next move
;; to play, in a chess position with 35 possible moves, most of the
;; time Stockfish will consider only the most promising one or two
;; moves.  This allows Stockfish to efficiently search much deeper
;; than chess engines that consider all 35 moves in detail.
;;
;; In this example we try to explore a few possible heuristics that
;; might let us avoid a high average branching factor, by avoiding
;; paths that semantically don't make sense, avoiding degenerate
;; entities like 'Disease', trying more specific variants of a class
;; of drugs first to reduce the branching factor, etc.
;;
;;
;; THE QUERY
;;
;; By the very nature of our specific query (trying to find surprising
;; candidate diseases that might be treated by a given drug), we know
;; that SemMedDB will not contain the edge:
;;
;;      Dg TREATS Ds
;;
;; (In fact, we will *insist* that such an edge doesn't exist, for Ds
;; to be considered a valid answer.)  So instead of looking for a
;; direct TREATS edge, we will try a more nuanced query:
;;
;; Find an "unknown" disease 'Ds' that is not known to be directly treated by the
;; given drug 'Dg', where there exists a gene 'Gn', a "known" disease
;; 'Ds_k', a cell function 'Cf' such that:
;;
;; The given drug Dg directly INHIBITS some gene Gn, *and*
;; the inhibited gene Gn directly CAUSES some "known" disease Ds_k, *and*
;; the given drug Dg directly TREATS the "known" disease Ds_k, *and*
;; the inhibited gene Gn directly CAUSES some cell function Cf, *and*
;; the cell function Cf directly AFFECTS some "unknown" disease Ds, *and*
;; the given drug Dg does *not* directly TREATS the "unknown" disease Ds, *and*
;; the "unknown" disease Ds directly is a MANIFESTATION_OF the cell function Cf.
;;
;; Upper-case verbs, such as INHIBITS and TREATS, are SemMedDB edge
;; "predicates".  Only the drug 'Dg' is given ("ground" in logic
;; programming terminology) in the query above.  All other entities
;; ('Gn', 'Ds_k', '', etc.) are unknown ("fresh" or "non-ground" in
;; logic programming terminology).  Even the "known" disease 'Ds_k'
;; starts out unknown.  'Ds_k' is a "known" disease only in the sense
;; that SemMedDB contains a direct TREATS edge between the given drug
;; 'Dg' and 'Ds_k'--we must discover that edge, and the disease
;; 'Ds_k', during the query.
;;
;; By parameterizing over the given drug 'Dg', we can turn this
;; specific query about imatinic into a more general "query schema"
;; that can be made to work for any drug.
;;
;; Part of the domain knowledge of a human user is encoded in the
;; *structure* of the query itself.  This structure includes:
;;
;; * which entities are connected to each other;
;;
;; * the exact predicates chosen ('CAUSES' is a "stronger", or more
;; specific, predicate than 'AFFECTS', which is stronger than
;; 'ASSOCIATED_WITH'),
;;
;; * the exact SemMedDB semantic types chosen--diseases of interest
;; may or may not include neoplasms (semantic type 'neop'), for
;; example.
;;
;;
;; THE FIGURES
;;
;; We found it helpful to ourselves, to keep everything straight, to
;; draw by hand several figures showing the simple/naive query, and
;; a more sophisticated version that involves reasoning and heuristics.
;;
;; The overview of a naive version of the query can be found at the top of
;; 
;;   imatinib_simple.jpg
;;
;; This is really only part of a naive query, showing the path we hope
;; to find connecting imatinib to asthma via the KIT gene and mast
;; cell activation.  Since there are over 180,000 relatively short
;; paths paths between imatinib and asthma, this path can be difficult
;; to find, even if you already knew to look for the connection to
;; asthma.  If you didn't know which of the 25,000 diseases in
;; SemMedDB might be connected to imatinib, this query would be very
;; difficult indeed.
;;
;; In the same file is an abstracted version of the query, showing the
;; abstract categories and connections we are interested in.  In this
;; case, we have also abstracted over the drug of interest: since none
;; of the entities are ground/concrete, this is a query schema that
;; could be applied to any drug.  Of course, it is unlikely to give
;; useful answers without significant human intervention to help prune
;; bogus and boring answers.
;;
;; A more sophisticated version of the query can be found in
;;
;;   imatinib_less_naive.jpg
;;
;; This figure shows branching factors we encountered when building up
;; the query by hand, while using various sorts of reasoning and
;; heuristics.  Unlike the naive queries, these sub-queries were
;; executed on a laptop within a few seconds to a few minutes, with
;; relatively small numbers of interesting answers produced at the end
;; (~111 diseases to consider by a human).  We aren't doing too much to
;; be efficient at this point--for example, we are representing sets as
;; lists, and taking other shortcuts.  With some cleverness, we think
;; we could both speed up the queries, and also cut down on the number of
;; bogus/uninteresting answers.
;;
;;
;; CHEATING, BUT NOT REALLY
;;
;; In this file we are hand-compiling parts of the overall query, and
;; using various heuristics and reasoning techniques.  We are most
;; interested in exploring *where we might get leverage to avoid
;; combinatorial explosion* while still keeping answers that are of
;; interest.  In this file we will shamelessly hand-compile or chain
;; together parts of the query, and wave our hands to point out how we
;; applied a certain optimization or bit of reasoning.  Obviously in a
;; real system a human would interact with the reasoning engine at a
;; much higher level of abstraction, and this code would be
;; automatically generated.  Also, we would need to implement the
;; reasoning in a more automatic fashion, and might want to tweak or
;; change some of the hueristics, call out to external ontologies like
;; SNOMED so we can do logical queries to determine how concepts are
;; related, etc.  We have tried to only include reasoning that we
;; think is generalizable, and which you might reasonably want to
;; apply for real queries.
;;
;; Obviously we are starting from an inherently cheating position,
;; since we know there is a connection bewteen imatinib and asthma.
;; However, we will try to be as honest as possible, and not use
;; tricks that just show asthma as the answer (ta da!).  Instead, we
;; want to make sure that each step we take, and each bit of reasoning
;; we employ, seems reasonable.  Over time we will learn which types
;; of reasoning seem to work best in practice--we might not use all of
;; these specific reasoning techniques, but we will use techniques
;; that are similar in spirit.

;; 10K lines of queries and answers exploring different possible
;; answers, approaches to reasoning, etc.  The examples and code below

;;; First bit of reasoning:
;;
;; We want to find candidate "unknown" diseases that might be treated by imatinib.
;; SemMedDB has multiple concepts related to imatinib, some very specific (Gleevec),
;; some less specific (the class of imatinib-related drugs).
;;
;; One simple bit of reasoning we can do is try to find the types of
;; imatinib-related compounds, and thir relationships.  An ontology
;; would be helpful here--we can get much of the way using the ISA
;; predicate in SemMedDB.  We can also look at branchiong factors for
;; the different drug/gene inhibition connections, for example.  Using
;; external sources as well, we can determine Gleevec is a trade name,
;; and is theremore more specific than the class of imatinib-related
;; compounds.  We can therefor use the heuristic that we are going to
;; start by searching for connections from Gleevec, rather than all
;; imatinib compounds, to try to reduce the branching factor.


;; Here are the relevant ISA queries:

;; ??? ISA imatinib
;;
;; Gleevec makes sense (brand name), and probably Imatinib mesylate.
;; STI571 is okay, probably. http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/STI-571.aspx
;; And CGP 57148.  https://www.biovision.com/imatinib-mesylate-cgp-57148b-sti-571.html
;;
;; The others seem...less good. 'Therapeutic procedure ISA imatinib' seems non-sensical.
;; 'Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ISA imatinib' seems backwards.

;; Here is a first attempt at pruning down the number of candidate
;; diseases, removing only those diseases known to be treated by our
;; specific drug of interest (Gleevec) rather than all forms of
;; imatinib.
;;
;; We found not only asthma, but a strong suggestion that Gleevec
;; might treat diabetes (something the query writer didn't know before
;; looking at these answers).  It turns out that the connection
;; between Gleevec and diabetes *is* known, but without using an
;; ontology or other ways to connect concepts, not all
;; diabetes-related entries were automatically removed.  Still, we
;; think this is interesting, since the connection to diabletes that
;; was discovered is *indirect*, and simulates the sort of discovery
;; we would hope for in practice.
;;
;;
;; Original comments follow:
;;
;;
;; remove from the 154 disorders (no neoplasms or pathologic functions)
;; of interest those 53 disorders, neoplasms, or pathologic functions
;; directly treated by Gleevec
;;
;; result is 151 diseases, including the useless "Disease" and "Syndrome" and "Degenerative disorder",
;; and including:
;; * at least 4 entries for epilepsy
;; * approximately 7 entries related to kidney/renal disease
;; * approximately 9 entries related to diabetes
;; etc.
;;
;; Seems like there are a number of groups of diseases within the 151
;; diseases.  For example, diabetes is probably worth a look.
;;
;; And, of course, there is the 1 entry for asthma
;;
;; Wow!

;; "The cancer drug imatinib—marketed as Gleevec and known as a game-changer for conditions like chronic myeloid leukemia—may prove the same in type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to a study published recently in Diabetes."
;;
;;
;; The article:
;;
;; http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/65/4/829
;;
;; Oh, SemMedDB does contain this information!  The list of diseases Gleevec treats includes:
;;
;; (11847 "Diabetes" ("dsyn"))
;; (11860 "Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent" ("dsyn"))
;;
;; The problem, of course, is that without doing more reasoning using
;; an ontology or external information, or maybe getting lucky with
;; the ISA predicate, the query has no way of knowing that those 9
;; diabetes-related entries are actually related to the entry
;; (11847 "Diabetes" ("dsyn")).
;;
